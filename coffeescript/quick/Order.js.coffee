An order is an instruction by a healthcare provider to another healthcare provider to perform some act.
 
@class Order
@exports  Order as quick.Order
###
class QUICK.Order
  constructor: (@json) ->
    super()
   
###*
The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
### 
  currentStatus: -> 
    for x in @json['currentStatus'] 
      new ActionStatus(x)
     
   
###*
The time when the ordered act is expected to be performed.
### 
  expectedPerformanceTime: -> 
    for x in @json['expectedPerformanceTime'] 
      new Period(x)
     
   
###*
Identifies a proposal that led to this order.
### 
  fromProposal: -> new StatementOfOccurrence( @json['fromProposal'] )
 
 
###*
Reason or justification for the action. Reasons may also be specified for not performing an action. 
### 
  indication: -> 
    for x in @json['indication'] 
      new Indication(x)
     
   
###*
The time at which the order was created.
### 
  orderedAtTime: ->  @json['orderedAtTime'] 
 
 
###*
The responsible person who places this order, e.g., physician. This may be different than the author of the order, e.g., clerk, who may be the statement's author.
### 
  orderedBy: -> 
    for x in @json['orderedBy'] 
      new Practitioner(x)
     
   
###*
The mode the order was received (such as by telephone, electronic, verbal, written). This describes 'how' the communication was done as opposed to dataSourceType which specifies the 'where' and 'from'.
### 
  originationMode: -> 
    for x in @json['originationMode'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
Preferences are choices made by patients about options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.
### 
  patientPreference: -> 
    for x in @json['patientPreference'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
The specific condition under which the act being ordered is performed. For example, Pain, Shortness of Breath, Insomnia, Nausea.

If this attribute is specified, it implies that the act must be performed as needed (i.e., is prn).

Reasons such as "SpO2 less than x%" should be addressed as a PRN Instruction rather than a PRN Reason as it is unlikely that a value set can be identified for such range of possible observations.
### 
  prnReason: -> 
    for x in @json['prnReason'] 
      new Indication(x)
     
   
###*
Provider preferences are choices made by care providers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals).
### 
  providerPreference: -> 
    for x in @json['providerPreference'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
The past statuses of this action, e.g., an order may evolve from draft to placed to in progress to completed or canceled.
### 
  statusHistory: -> 
    for x in @json['statusHistory'] 
      new ActionStatus(x)
     
   
###*
Characterizes how quickly the action must be initiated. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
### 
  urgency: -> 
    for x in @json['urgency'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
