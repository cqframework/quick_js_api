An proposal to supply and/or administer a medication to a patient.

<b>Example</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
Aspirin 81 mg ,one tablet per day orally was proposed

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let AspirinProposal = 
  [MedicationTreatment, Proposal: "Aspirin"] A where
    dosage[1].doseQuantity = 81 u 'mg'
    and
    IsEquivalent(dosage[1].route, OralRouteCode)
    and
    IsEquivalent((dosage[1].administrationFrequency.cycle.cycleTiming as CodedRecurringEvent).repeatCode, OncePerDayCode)
 
@class MedicationTreatmentProposalOccurrence
@exports  MedicationTreatmentProposalOccurrence as quick.MedicationTreatmentProposalOccurrence
###
class QUICK.MedicationTreatmentProposalOccurrence
  constructor: (@json) ->
    super()
   
###*
Details about the clinical statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
### 
  additionalText: ->  @json['additionalText'] 
 
 
###*
The status of an action. It is expected that the range of values for statusCode (i.e., the value set) will vary by the subtypes of Action. For example, Proposal might have one of its status value as Declined.
### 
  currentStatus: -> 
    for x in @json['currentStatus'] 
      new ActionStatus(x)
     
   
###*
Dispensation details to be used only when needed, e.g., as part of a statement about a prescription or a dispensation event.
### 
  dispense: -> 
    for x in @json['dispense'] 
      new Dispense(x)
     
   
###*
Details for the dose or doses of medication administered or to be administered to the patient
### 
  dosage: -> 
    for x in @json['dosage'] 
      new Dosage(x)
     
   
###*
The encounter within which the clinical statement was created.
### 
  encounter: -> 
    for x in @json['encounter'] 
      new StatementOfOccurrence(x)
     
   
###*
The time when the action is expected to be performed.
### 
  expectedPerformanceTime: -> 
    for x in @json['expectedPerformanceTime'] 
      new Period(x)
     
   
###*
<font color="#0f0f0f">A unique ID of this clinical statement for reference purposes. It must be provided if user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be auto-generated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of the source system. </font>
### 
  identifier: -> 
    for x in @json['identifier'] 
      new Identifier(x)
     
   
###*
Reason or justification for the action. Reasons may also be specified for not performing an action. 
### 
  indication: -> 
    for x in @json['indication'] 
      new Indication(x)
     
   
###*
Identifies the medication being dispensed or administered.
### 
  medication: -> 
    for x in @json['medication'] 
      new Medication(x)
     
   
###*
The modality of a Clinical Statement describes the way the topic exists, happens, or is experienced.
### 
  modality: -> new StatementModality( @json['modality'] )
 
 
###*
The mode by which the proposal was received (such as by telephone, electronic, verbal, written). This describes 'how' the communication was done as opposed to dataSourceType which specifies the 'where' and 'from'.
### 
  originationMode: -> 
    for x in @json['originationMode'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
Preferences are choices made by patients about options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.
### 
  patientPreference: -> 
    for x in @json['patientPreference'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
The specific condition under which the act being proposed is performed. For example, Pain, Shortness of Breath, Insomnia, Nausea.

If this attribute is specified, it implies that the act must be performed as needed (i.e., is prn).

Reasons such as "SpO2 less than x%" should be addressed as a PRN Instruction rather than a PRN Reason as it is unlikely that a value set can be identified for such range of possible observations.
### 
  prnReason: -> 
    for x in @json['prnReason'] 
      new Indication(x)
     
   
###*
The identifier of a set of constraints placed on a clinical statement.  If there are multiple templates specified for the element, then the element must satisfy ALL constraints defined in ANY template at that level.
###

      new Identifier(x)

    for x in @json['providerPreference'] 
      new CodeableConcept(x)
     
   
###*
The person who created the statement.

The source and the author of the statement may differ. Statement source is the system from which the statement originated. This may be an EHR or it may be a medical device. 

The statement author is the person creating the statement in the medical record. This may be a person who validates the data from a device, or obtains the history from a subject, a family member, or other source.
### 
  statementAuthor: -> 
    for x in @json['statementAuthor'] 
      new Person(x)

###*
The person, device, or other system that was the source of this statement.
### 
  statementSource: ->
