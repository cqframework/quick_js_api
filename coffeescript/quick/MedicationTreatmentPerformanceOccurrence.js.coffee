###*
The performance of a medication treatment action. This statement can describes the action of administering one dose, administering a course of medication, or the dispensing of medication. The attribute actionPerformed (in Performance) can distinguish these variants of the statement.

<b>Example 1</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
"Medication, Administered: Hospital measures-IV Vancomycin (route: "Hospital measures-Route IV")" 

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let VancoDoseAdmin =
  [MedicationTreatment, Performance: "Hospital measures-IV Vancomycin"] V 
    where
    dosage[1].route in "Hospital measures-Route IV"
      and IsEquivalent(actionPerformed, DoseAdministrationActionCode)
       
<b>Example 2</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
Medication dispensed: Medications indicative of diabetes

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let DiabetesMedsDispensed =
  [MedicationTreatment, Performance: "Medications indicative of diabetes"] M 
    where
      IsEquivalent(actionPerformed, MedicationDispensedActionCode)

###*
Attribute that specifies the component of a composite action that was performed. For instance, the fulfillment of a prescription may result in both a substance administration event and a dispense event, thus resulting in two actions being performed.

    where
    dosage[1].route in "Hospital measures-Route IV"
      and IsEquivalent(actionPerformed, DoseAdministrationActionCode)
