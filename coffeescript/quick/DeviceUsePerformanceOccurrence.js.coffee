The provision of the device to the patient and their use of the device.

<b>Example</b>
<u>Expression from source knowledge artifact</u>
Device, Applied: Hospital Measures-Indwelling urinary catheter

<u>Expression in CQL+QUICK</u>
let UsedIndwellingCath =
  [DeviceUse, Performance: "Hospital Measures-Indwelling urinary catheter"]

###*
Attribute that specifies the component of a composite action that was performed. For instance, the fulfillment of a prescription may result in both a substance administration event and a dispense event, thus resulting in two actions being performed.

let VancoDoseAdmin =

    where
    dosage[1].route in "Hospital measures-Route IV"
      and IsEquivalent(actionPerformed, DoseAdministrationActionCode)
